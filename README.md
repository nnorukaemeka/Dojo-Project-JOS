# Dojo-Project-JOS
# Code Plateau 1.0 Bootcamp.

The Dojo Project is about a system that automatically allocates an office to a new Code Plateau staff, and an office with (optional living space) to a new Code Plateau Participant(or Fellow).

<b>Problem Description:</b> When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space if they choose to opt in. When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only. In this exercise you will be required to digitize and randomize a room allocation system for one of Andela Kenyaâ€™s facilities called The Dojo.
