# Dojo-Project-JOS
### Code Plateau 1.0 Bootcamp @NHub Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria.

<b>The Dojo Project</b> is about a system that automatically allocates an office to a new Code Plateau Staff, and also to a new Code Plateau Participant (or Fellow) with an optional living space (if the Participant chooses to opt in).

<b>Problem Description:</b> When a new Code Plateau Participant joins the program, he is assigned an office space and an optional living space if he chooses to opt in. When a new Staff (anyone that is not a Participant) joins, he is assigned an office space only. You are required to digitize and randomize a room allocation system for one of Code Plateauâ€™s centers (i.e NHub) called The Dojo.

<b>Constraints:</b> The Dojo has rooms, which can be offices or living spaces. An office can accommodate a maximum of 6 people. A living space can accommodate a maximum of 4 people.
A person to be allocated could be a Participant or Staff. Staff cannot be allocated living spaces. Participants have the option to choose a living space or skip.
This system will be used to automatically allocate spaces to new Staff and Participant of Code Plateau @Nhub(Dojo) at random.

<b>Background:</b> This project is the same with Andela cohort xvii Boot camp project, and a recommended way of handling this project is by proper understanding of Programming Basics, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Test Driven Development (TDD) in Python. Anderson Masese did good job <a href="https://github.com/AndersonMasese/Anderson-Masese-Dojo-Project#sample-output-with-multiple-offices">here</a> using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 

But wait! if you're a Python Beginner and have not done Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), what other options do you have to handle this project? Or if you are a love of Python 'List' and 'Dictionary' like me, what would you do to play around the project?

<b>Now, Let's keep it SIMPLE with Python lists, dictionaries and functions.</b> No 'class'!, No 'method'!!, No 'OOP'!!!
My approach is fun and simple, but then it handles the Problem and the constraints described above.</b>

Don't spend further time reading this... just clone the repository and have FUN!!!
